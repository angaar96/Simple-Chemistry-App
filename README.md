# Simple-Chemistry-App 

A small chemistry focused Windows application made by me using Python, currently with the following functionality:

The app displays properties (e.g. atomic mass) of the chemical elements, which are pulled from a .csv database. This is done using pandas.
You can convert between mass and molar fractions for a mixture of up to 4 compounds using the element properties indexed using pandas. The application then outputs a pie chart with the desired compositions. Data visualisation is done via matplotlib.

The code for the project is freely available to browse in the main.py file. 

To use the app, please go to my releases and launch the .exe file.
