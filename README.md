# Simple-Chemistry-App 

A small chemistry focused Windows application made by me using Python, currently with the following functionality:

The app displays properties (e.g. atomic mass) of the chemical elements, which are pulled from a .csv database. This is done using pandas.
You can convert between mass and molar fractions for a mixture of up to 4 compounds using the element properties indexed using pandas. The application then outputs a pie chart with the desired compositions. Data visualisation is done via matplotlib.

To install just click download Chemistry_app.exe and run it.

The code for this project is freely available to browse in my repositories.

Features that are in the works:

Cleaner, class based code leaning more on OOP principles
More calculation functionality (e.g. calculate concentrations)
More chemical engineering specific features (e.g. unit conversion)
Prettier and more logical UI/design.
Lighter program size.
SQL database of some kind to save compounds.
Error control.
